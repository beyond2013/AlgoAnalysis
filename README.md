# Course title: Advanced Algorithm Analysis
- Course code: CS-702
- Credit Hours: 3
- Prerequisite: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Outline:

- Advanced algorithm analysis including the introduction of formal techniques and the underlying mathematical theory.
- NP-completeness.
- Search Techniques.
- Randomized Algorithms.
- Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms.
- Topics include asymptotic analysis of upper and average complexity bounds using big-O, little-o, and theta notation.
- Fundamental algorithmic strategies (brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, backtracking, branch-and-bound, pattern matching, and numerical approximations).
- Standard graph and tree algorithms.
- Standard complexity classes, time and space trade offs in algorithms
- Using recurrence relations to analyze recursive algorithms
- Non-computable functions 
- The halting problem, and the implications of non-computability.

## Course Objectives:

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to explain the mathematical concepts used in describing the complexity of an algorithm, and select and apply algorithms appropriate to a particular situation.

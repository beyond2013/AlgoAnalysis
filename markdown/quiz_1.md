Question 1: Calculate the following expression for n=4. To calculate log assume base two:

 i. $\sqrt{n}$
 ii. $\log{n}$
 iii. $n \log{n}$
 iv. $n^2$
 v. $n^3$ 
 vi. $2^n$
 vii. $n!$


Question 2: State whether the following statements are true or false:

1. Both Algorithm and logarithm means the same.

2. Given a single input, if the algorithm produces correct output the algorithm is said to be correct.

3. An incorrect algorithm never stops.

4. An incorrect algorithm stops with incorrect answer.

5. Because an incorrect algorithm stops with incorrect answer it is useless.

6. An algorithm can be specified in Urdu

7. An algorithm can be specified as a computer program

8. An algorithm can be specified as a hardware design

9. Linked lists and arrays are both algorithms.

10. Arrays and linked lists are both data structures.

11. Algorithms can be categorized as technology.

12. Suppose A and B are 2 sorting algorithms, run time of A is $\log{n}$, Run time of B is $n!$, B is better than A.

13. For some problems no efficient solution is known.

# Getting Started

## Pseudocode

- Algorithms are specified using pseudocode
- Pseudocode is similar in many respect to C, C++, Java, Python.
- Pseudocode may include English phrase or sentence 
- Pseudocode is not concerned with issues of software engineering.
- Issues of data abstraction, modularity, and error handling are often ignored.


## Insertion sort

**Input:** A sequence of n numbers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>,...., a<sub>n</sub>  
**Output:**  A permutation (reordering) of the input sequence such that a<sub>1</sub> <= a<sub>2</sub> <= a<sub>3</sub> <= .... <= a<sub>n</sub>  

- The numbers that we wish to sort are also known as the **keys**.
- insertion sort is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements.
- It works similar to how people sort a hand of playing cards.

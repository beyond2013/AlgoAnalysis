What are algorithms?

-	Informally an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that take some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values as output.

- An Algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

Example: sorting a sequence of number

Input: A sequence of n numbers a1, a2, a3,...., an 
Output: A permutation (reordering) of the input sequence such that a1 <= a2 <= a3 <=, ....., <=an

Which Algorithm is best for a given application depends on
- the number of items to be sorted
- the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted,
- possible restriction on the item values
- the architecture of the computer
- the kidn of storage devices to be used (main memory, disks, or tapes)

An algorithm is said to be correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output. 

An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer.

An Algorithm can be specified 
i. in English,
ii. as a computer program, or even 
iii. as a hardware design.

The only requirement is that the specification must provide a precise description of the computational procedure to be followed.


What kind of problems are solved by algorithms?  
Practical applications of algorithms are ubiquitous and include the following.

1. identifying all the 100,000 genes in human DNA.
2. finding good routes on which the data will travel on the internet
3. public-key cryptography and digital signatures used in E-commerce
4. linear programming
5. shortest path in a graph
6. longest common subsequence
